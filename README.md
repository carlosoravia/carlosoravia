## Sites i've workied on
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.duelune.com/" target="_blank">duelune.com</a>: for this site i've developed the entire front-end from an UX/UI develeped from an external team, my role on this project was to follow the screenshots given by the other team and nothing more. 
      <br>
      I used Tiwig as engine template (PHP based) with a CSM for special offers or other dynamic contents.
      <br>
      For front-end part we decided to use Bootstrap for gryds parts, Jquery / CSS for animations and Vanilla Javascript fot the logic.  
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.berinox.com/" target="_blank">berinox.com</a>: The frontend of the site was an already existing template which was created by an old employee of the company.
        <br>
        For this project i've created all the pages but i didn't touch the navbar or other parts, my task was to create the pages and improve the video on the homepage. 
        <br>
        It uses Twig as engine template, Bootstrap 3 plus CSS for gryds and JS for the logic. 
    </li>
  </ul>
