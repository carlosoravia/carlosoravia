## Sites i've workied on
<p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.duelune.com/" target="_blank">duelune.com</a>: for this site i've developed the entire front-end from an UX/UI develeped from an external team, my role on this projectt was to follow the screenshots given by the other team and nothing more. 
      <br>
      I used Tiwig as engine template (PHP based) with a CSM for special offers or other dynamic contents.
      <br>
      For front-end part we decided to use Bootstrap for gryds parts, Jquery / CSS for animations and Vanilla Javascript fot the logic.
