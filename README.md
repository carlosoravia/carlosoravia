## Sites I've worked on
[duelune.com:](https://www.duelune.com/) For this site i've developed the entire front-end from an UX/UI develeped from an external team, my role on this project was to follow the screenshots given by the other team and nothing more.
I used Tiwig as engine template (PHP based) with a CSM for special offers or other dynamic contents.
For front-end part we decided to use Bootstrap for gryds parts, Jquery / CSS for animations and Vanilla Javascript fot the logic.
Some "view more" buttons have a second hidden text, clicking it activates its visibility, changes the button text and also the client window focuses on the new text shown.
This feature was created with Javascript Vanilla.

[berinox.com:](https://www.berinox.com/) The frontend of the site was an already existing template which was created by an old employee of the company.
For this project i've created all the pages but i didn't touch the navbar or other parts, my task was to create the pages and improve the video on the homepage.
It uses Twig as engine template, Bootstrap 3 plus CSS for gryds and JS for the logic.

## Something more about me!

I really enjoy playing instruments such: guitar ðŸŽµ, bass ðŸŽ¸ and piano ðŸŽ¹.

I started as a self-taught with no expectation and i've found one of my deepest passion.
